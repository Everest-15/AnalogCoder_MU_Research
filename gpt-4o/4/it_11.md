# Task 4, iteration 11

## Description
A single-stage common-gate amplifier with resistive load R (input signal Vin must be applied at the source terminal)

## LLM Output

### Task 1

#### Components Needed
- **NMOS Transistor**: M1
- **Resistor**: R1 for the load
- **Power Supply**: Vdd for DC supply
- **Input Signal Source**: Vin, Vbias for biasing and signal input
- **Capacitors**: Not specified but can be included for coupling and bypass applications if required

#### Single-Stage Common-Gate Amplifier with Resistive Load

1. **Transistor Setup**:
   - **M1** (NMOS) is the main amplifying transistor.
   - Source of **M1** is connected to the input node **Vin**.
   - Gate of **M1** is connected to **Vbias** to keep it at a constant potential and ensure it operates in the saturation region.
   - Drain of **M1** is connected to the output node **Vout**.

2. **Load and Coupling**:
   - **R1** is connected between the drain of **M1** and **Vdd**. This resistor serves as the load and converts the current through **M1** into an output voltage.

3. **Biasing**:
   - **Vbias** is used to set the gate voltage of **M1** to ensure proper operation.
   - **Vin** is the input signal applied at the source of **M1**.

### Task 2

```python
from PySpice.Spice.Netlist import Circuit
from PySpice.Unit import *

circuit = Circuit('Single-Stage Common-Gate Amplifier')
# Define the MOSFET model
circuit.model('nmos_model', 'nmos', level=1, kp=100e-6, vto=0.5)

# Power Supply for the power and input signal
circuit.V('dd', 'Vdd', circuit.gnd, 5.0)  # 5V power supply
circuit.V('in', 'Vin', circuit.gnd, 1.0)  # 1V input for bias voltage (= V_th + 0.5 = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0)
circuit.V('bias', 'Vbias', circuit.gnd, 2.0)  # Bias voltage for gate (= Vth + 0.5 = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0)

# Common-Gate Amplifier with Resistor Load
# parameters: name, drain, gate, source, bulk, model, w, l
circuit.MOSFET('1', 'Vout', 'Vbias', 'Vin', 'Vin', model='nmos_model', w=50e-6, l=1e-6)
circuit.R('1', 'Vout', 'Vdd', 1@u_kÎ©)

```

This design ensures that the single-stage common-gate amplifier is properly configured, with input applied at the source and output taken from the drain. The resistor R1 serves as the load, converting the current into a voltage at the output node.
