### Task 1

#### Components Needed
- **NMOS Transistor**: M1
- **Resistor**: R1 for the load
- **Power Supply**: Vdd for DC supply
- **Input Signal Source**: Vin for the input signal, Vbias for biasing
- **Capacitors**: Not specified but can be included for coupling and bypass applications if required

#### Common-Gate Amplifier with Resistor Load
1. **Transistor Setup**:
   - **M1** (NMOS) is configured as the amplifying transistor in a common-gate configuration.
   - The gate of **M1** is connected to the bias voltage **Vbias**.
   - The source of **M1** is connected to the input node **Vin**.
   - The drain of **M1** is connected to the output node **Vout**.

2. **Biasing**:
   - **Vbias** is used to set the gate voltage of **M1** to ensure it operates in the saturation region.
   - The bias voltage should be set to a value that allows the transistor to remain in saturation for the expected input signal range.

3. **Load and Coupling**:
   - **R1** is connected between the drain of **M1** and **Vdd**. This resistor converts the current through **M1** into an output voltage at **Vout**.

```

This code sets up a single-stage common-gate amplifier with an NMOS transistor and a resistive load. The input signal is applied at the source of the NMOS, while the gate is connected to a bias voltage, ensuring proper operation in the saturation region. The output is taken from the drain of the NMOS, connected through a resistor to Vdd.
